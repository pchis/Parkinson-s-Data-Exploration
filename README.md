# Parkinson-s-Data-Exploration
This project is a personal project to increase my experience with data science tools by exploring a dataset relevant to human health.

In this project I explore publicly available data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons+Telemonitoring) and attempt to predict the severity of a patient's Parkinson's disease from characteristics of voice recordings.

This data has been previously analyzed in a publication by the group which provided the dataset (http://www.cabdyn.ox.ac.uk/complexity_PDFs/Network%20Journal%20Club%20PDFs/athanasios.pdf). In order to think through the data myself and not simply repeat their findings, I only used the publication for information regarding their data collection.
